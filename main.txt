Sure! Here's an example of a Python code for recursion that calculates the factorial of a number:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# Example usage
num = 5
result = factorial(num)
print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {result}")
```

In this code, the `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates its factorial using recursion. The base case is when `n` is 0, in which case the function returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`. Finally, we can test the code by calculating the factorial of 5 and printing the result.
